# cmsi385

Final Project for CMSI 385 (Fall 2019)

### Final Project Proposal

For my final project, I plan on developing an NFA Simulator using python.

To run the program, run `python3 nfa.py` in your terminal.<br /> 
To change the test file, edit the line `file = open("input.txt", "r")` at the top of the file with whichever test file you would like to use. I added the files `test.txt` and `test2.txt` as alternate test files.
